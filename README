---Gabe and Bruce's Project E Submission---
    This submission contains all of the code for
Project E of Operating Systems Fall '22. All steps
per instruction have been completed, and as with
previous submissions all steps can be tested with
the commands each step leading up to Step 7 of this
project have implemented.
    (Note: Copy command cannot copy from a file that
has less that 6 characters in its name, but can copy
to a file that has less than 6 characters)
    Project E's functionality according to the 
completion of all steps can be tested by using the
"exec" command with "tstpr2" as the file to run on 
the disk. To run a program with the intention to
kill it, use the "bexec" command followed by the
program's filename.
