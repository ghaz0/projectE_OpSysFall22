---Gabe and Bruce's Project E Submission---
    This submission contains all of the code for
Project E of Operating Systems Fall '22. All steps
per instruction have been completed, and as with
previous submissions all steps can be tested with
the commands each step leading up to Step 7 of this
project have implemented.
    Project E's functionality according to the 
completion of all steps can be tested by using the
"exec" command with "tstpr2" as the file to run on 
the disk. This file can also be killed, however as
of this submission (days prior to the demo) due
to an issue implementing step 7, the ability to kill
a function as it is running is hampered by a 
modified execution call in the shell. The additions
to the call make it so the shell no longer
accepts any further input while another process
is running in the background. Thus, one cannot
kill a process unless the current process
is the shell itself. This will be
addressed before the in-lecture demo. Yet so, the code in
the kernel and shell, particularly the killProcess
and terminate functions in the kernel, should show
how both operate.
